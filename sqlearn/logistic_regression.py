    """
    A class that represents a trainable logistic regression binary 
    classifier.
    Uses average negative log likelihood as the loss function.

    Attributes:
    ----------
    thresh (default=0.5)
        The threshold at which predictions from the logistic regressor
        change from 0 to 1. If thresh=None, then the model will output
        probabilities instead of classifications.
    epochs (default=5)
        The number of passes the model makes through the dataset.
    batch_size (default=1)
        The number of observations used to calculate the gradient during
        the process of stochastic gradient descent.
    learning_rate (default=0.001)
        The rate at which the model changes during stochastic gradient
        descent.
    l2_reg_weight (default=0)
        The weight used for the L2 regularization. Use 0 for no L2
        regularization.
    seed (default=0)
        The seed used for random processes.
    
    Functions:
    ----------
    calc_gradient(self, batch_X, batch_y)
        A function that calculates the gradient of the loss function.
    sgd(self, batch_X, batch_y):
        Performs one step of stochastic gradient descent.
    train(self, X, y):
        Trains the model on a dataset and the corresponding labels.
    predict(self, X):
        Makes prediction from a dataframe of observations.
    get_weights(self):
        Returns the trained weights of the model.
