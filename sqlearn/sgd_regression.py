    A parent class for a regression model that's trained using stochastic

    The functions calc_gradient and predict are not implemented.

    Attributes:
    ----------
    epochs (default=5)
        The number of passes the model makes through the dataset.
    batch_size (default=1)
        The number of observations used to calculate the gradient during
        the process of stochastic gradient descent.
    learning_rate (default=0.001)
        The rate at which the model changes during stochastic gradient
        descent.
    seed (default=0)
        The seed used for random processes.
    
    Functions:
    ----------
    calc_gradient(self, batch_X, batch_y) [NOT IMPLEMENTED]
        A function that calculates the gradient of the loss function.

        Makes prediction from a dataframe of observations.
