    A parent class for a regression model that's trained using stochastic 
    gradient descent and optional L2 regularization. 
    
    The functions calc_gradient and predict are not implemented.

    Attributes:
    ----------
    epochs (default=5)
        The number of passes the model makes through the dataset.
    batch_size (default=1)
        The number of observations used to calculate the gradient during
        the process of stochastic gradient descent.
    learning_rate (default=0.001)
        The rate at which the model changes during stochastic gradient
        descent.
    l2_reg_weight (default=0)
        The weight used for the L2 regularization. Use 0 for no L2
        regularization.
    seed (default=0)
        The seed used for random processes.
    
    Functions:
    ----------
